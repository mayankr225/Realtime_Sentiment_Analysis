# Realtime_Sentiment_Analysis
This repository implements a cloud-based solution for sentiment analysis on Reddit comments. Using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink, the project processes a stream of data to train a machine learning model. A web-based dashboard displays how sentiments for user-defined keywords evolve over time. The entire solution is containerized using Docker.
